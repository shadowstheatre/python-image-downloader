# Description of the image download script

The script.py script is designed to download images from a text file containing image URLs.

# Download_images_from_file function

The download_images_from_file function takes as input the path to the file containing the image URLs.

1. Opens the file and reads the image URLs.
2. For each URL, do the following:
- Remove spaces and newlines from the URL.
- Make a GET request to the URL to get the response.
- If the response has a status code of 200 (OK), proceed with the image download.
- Extracts the year from the URL structure and creates a corresponding folder structure.
- Save the image with the name taken from the URL in the corresponding folder.
- Print a success message.
- If the year cannot be found in the URL, print an error message.
- If the request has a status code other than 200, print an error message.
- If an exception occurs while downloading the image, print an error message.
Using the script

To use the script, you need to specify the path to the file containing the image URLs. In this case, the file path is "url.txt".

To run the script, simply type

`python3 script.py`

in a terminal window opened inside the directory of the script.

The script will download images from the URLs specified in the file and save them in the corresponding folder structure.
